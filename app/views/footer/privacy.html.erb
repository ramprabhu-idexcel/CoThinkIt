						<p>At <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a>, we recognize that privacy is important.

						<h4>Other sites</h4>

						<p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> sites and <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed or made available from within our services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>

						<p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and</li>
							<li>Protect the rights or property of <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> or our users.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>

						<p><a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> processes personal information on servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>

						<h4>Choices</h4>

						<p>When you sign up for <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a>, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>

						<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>

						<p>You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>

						<h4>Information sharing</h4>

						<p><a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> in the following limited circumstances:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
							<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
							<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a>, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>

						</ul>

						<p>If <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

						<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at support@cothinkit.com for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>

						<h4>Information security</h4>

						<p>We restrict access to personal information to <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

						<h4>Accessing and updating personal information</h4>

						<p>When you use <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

						<p>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.</p>

						<p>In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>

						<h4>Enforcement</h4>

						<p>When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a>'s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a> and an individual.</p>

						<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

						<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page.</p>

						<p>Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or <a href="/">co&middot;think&middot;it</a>'s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at support@cothinkit.com.</p>
